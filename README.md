# ANOVA Analysis for Precision Agriculture

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to analyze the impact of environmental factors such as humidity, rainfall, and temperature on crop recommendations. The analysis uses the **Crop Recommendation Dataset** from Kaggle and provides insights into how these factors influence crop growth and selection.

---

## Features
- Data exploration and visualization of environmental factors.
- ANOVA analysis for:
  - Humidity
  - Rainfall
  - Temperature
- Comparison of factor impacts on crop selection.

# Outputs
## Visualizations:
Histograms for temperature, humidity, and rainfall distributions.
## ANOVA Results:
F-Statistic and p-value for each factor.
Comparison of the significance of humidity, rainfall, and temperature.
